## My application

Using the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) data from the national center for education statistics website (http://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/datacenter/DataFiles.aspx), I developed an application using shiny. The app allows users to select a U.S. state or territory and determine how many institutions of higher education exist within that state. An interactive histogram shows how many states have:

* 0-100 institutions
* 100-200 institutions
* 200-300 institutions
* 300-400 institutions
* 400-500 institutions
* 500-600 institutions
* 600-700 institutions
* 700-800 institutions

The histogram also displays the "median state" which has 96 institutions, and reactively draws a vertical line indicating the # of institutions that exist in the selected state.
